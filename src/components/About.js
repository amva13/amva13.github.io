              {`Alejandro Velez Arce was born and raised in Puerto Rico, born to a culture and friends at school from all over the world, all kinds of ethnicities, and socioeconomic circumstances, which taught him the value of a diverse group of people to provide insights and culture to one's life and perspective. This is an outlook he's carried to multiple aspects of my life and career`}

              {`His interest in the sciences, especially in physics and mathematics, as well as a budding passion for entrepreneurship led him to apply to and choose MIT for his undergraduate degree. In high school, he'd shown strength in math and science, built great relationships with his teachers in those fields, and had great success in scientific research pursuits, which led him to believe the communities and intellectual pursuits of science and engineering would be things he'd enjoy. This ended up very much being the case, as his choice of MIT was driven quite strongly by the people he met throughout the pre-decision process. In addition, he'd lived in a commonwealth whose potential, at the time, was inhibited by a bloated and sluggish government, and massive bureaucratic private sector institutions unable to provide the innovation and prosperity the great people of Puerto Rico needed to unleash their full potential. This drove his interest in entrepreneurship, and he looked to many lovely people he met in Puerto Rico who had started their own business for inspiration. However, he was also driven by academia, having a very accomplished academic as a Father, who also happened to go to MIT, and he looked to how he could connect entrepreneurial passion with academic greatness and scientific achievement beyond what was exhibited by the entrepreneurs he'd been exposed to in my day-to-day life.`}

              {`His professional life has been marked by a passion for computer science. As a young student, he was amazed by the sheer power of the field's problem-solving philosophy and the degree of impact one could have in so many fields, being amazed by the computational modeling of human cognition he learned about through his coursework and his ability to have impact across gerrymandering cases all over the nation through code he developed during research at MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The latter experience was his first practical exposure to high performance scientific computing. The ability to use different aspects of computation, from geometric algorithm optimization to distributed systems for data processing and Python/C++ programming considerations to advance the practice of science on a high impact problem in social justice was exciting to him and researching and leveraging applied mathematical techniques for modeling political redistricting systems allowed him to take on challenges in political science in a way better suiting his interests. He would carry this interest in high performance scientific computation further in his career.`}

Despite his success at Pinterest, having been promoted within my first year at the company and published in the Pinterest Engineering Blog, he went on to face tremendous mental health challenges after his first two years in the company, exacerbated by the most significant global event in my lifetime, the global shutdowns associated with the COVID pandemic. It was during this time that, after also evaluating previous episodes of struggles with mental health, he was diagnosed with bipolar manic disorder. He worked through distinct medical and behavioral treatments between 2020 and 2022 to reach where he is now, having turned the corner and developed stronger mental health resilience and positivity than ever before. However, this experience, along with misdiagnoses and battles with the side effects of some of the medications, ignited an interest in his researching the use of AI and scientific computing to advance the production and discovery of new, cheaper, and better medications, which led to his launching Alphunt, a generative artificial intelligence platform for drug discovery. In particular, his interest is in developing AI and computing systems leveraging the converging advances in science and modeling technology for molecular simulation and its promise in the areas of energy, sustainability, and health.`}
